AWS Well-Architected and the Six Pillars
The AWS Well-Architected Framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud.
By answering a few foundational questions, learn how well your architecture aligns with cloud best practices and gain guidance for making improvements.

 Operational Excellence Pillar — Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
 Performance Efficiency Pillar — The performance efficiency pillar focuses on the structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.
 Reliability Pillar — The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.
 Security Pillar — The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.
Cost Optimisation Pillar — The cost optimisation pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
 Sustainability Pillar — The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.
